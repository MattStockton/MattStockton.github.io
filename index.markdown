### Hello, I'm Matt!


I live in Shorewood, WI (just outside of Milwaukee). I've been building software and leading software teams professionally for 20+ years, mostly at small VC-backed startup companies. My core areas of focus are Data Engineering and Machine Learning. My current technical interests are around emerging AI capabilities, specifically Large Language Models. I'm also interested in family, running, reading, meditation, investing, coffee, history, and happiness.

I'm writing about what I'm learning [here](/writing.html)

Want to work with me? Read more about what I am interested in, and [what I can offer](/work-with-me.html)
