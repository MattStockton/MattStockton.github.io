Hey there, I'm Matt Stockton. I'm based in Milwaukee, WI. I've been building software and leading software teams professionally for 20+ years, mostly at small VC-backed startup companies. My core areas of focus have been Data Engineering and Machine Learning. My current interests are mainly around emerging AI capabilities, specifically Large Language Models. I'll store my thoughts here when I can. How can I help you? Send me an email and let's talk.

Here are some things that I care about: Family, Reading, Writing, Running, Stretching, Technology, History, Mental Health, Coffee, Happiness
