title:  "Summarizing and creating a reading list with ChatGPT"
---

## Summary
I like to read books. I'm always looking for ways to discover new titles. I mainly use Goodreads and Twitter as a discovery mechanism, and I use Goodreads to track my reading queue. I love when I find lists of books that others are reading, particularly when I discover a book I hadn't come across yet. It's been a while, but I shared my [top books from 2013](/2014/01/12/top-books-from-2013.html). I've read a lot between then and now, but haven't shared any of my lists. I wanted to see how I could use ChatGPT to build a similar summary list, with limited manual effort. I also wanted to see how I could use ChatGPT to find new recommendations based on books I've enjoyed.

Below, I'll share some learnings from this experiment, along with my reading list, and a new list of books recommended through using ChatGPT

## Steps and learnings with ChatGPT Prompting

- To build the initial list of books, I used this prompt:
  > I am going to give you a list of books below. I will be speaking them. I want you to take the title of the book and find the author of the book and create a bulleted list with all of the books. I'm going to speak starting now...(followed by me iterating over the book titles)...

  ChatGPT was able to build a bulleted list of all the books. Looking at the final prompt, there were some spelling errors and lack of separation between the spoken book titles due to speech-to-text -- but it was able to figure it out.

- ChatGPT was able to summarize the books and provide some representative quotes from the books. I used the following prompt (again, I was using speech-to--text to generate the prompt):
  >  I want you to take the above list and modify it in the following way for each book I want you to add a bullet under the book with a one to two sentence summary of what the book is about. I want you to add another bullet for each book that represents one of the most popular quotes from the book.

- I played around with the summary and quote content length. I also augmented each book with a link to its Amazon page.
  > For the original list of books that contain summary and a single quote, can you please make the title of the book a clickable link to where you can buy it on Amazon
  >
  >  can you modify the summary to be a bit more detailed maybe 3 to 5 sentences. Also, can you provide 2 to 3 different quotes for each one?

- I was a bit more specific when I asked ChatGPT to generate a future reading list. Here's the prompt I used
  > Given the above list of books, I want you to do the following:
  >   - Generate me a list of 10 possible books to read
  >   - The book recommendations should be informed by themes in the above books, and the likelihood that I will find them enjoyable given my interests above
  >   - The books should be less well known
  >   - The books should be written before the year 2000
  >   - Please provide these books in the same format used above

- I used ChatGPT to adjust the styling of the list, so that I could just copy/paste it in this post here. I asked it to create Markdown, and then played around with the formatting via a few iterative prompts. Here are two examples:
  > Can you format the list of books I read in markdown
  >
  > I want you to change the markdown so that, instead of having a bullet with the word quotes followed by a bullet list of quotes, I want to have a markdown quoted bulleted list using the quote capabilities of markdown


- ChatGPT did choose a few incorrect Amazon links, which I had to adjust manually

- The future reading list ChatGPT generated looks promising. I've only read 2 of the 10, and I haven't heard of most of the others

- I did attempt to get ChatGPT to write this post, but was unsatisfied with how it read. I decided to write the main post from scratch, rather than attempt to edit what it gave me. This is the prompt I used to try to write the post (it wasn't terrible, but didn't sound like me)
> I want to write a short post on my personal site highlighting the workflow I went through above to generate the list of books. Here is the criteria for the post:
>   - I want it to be in the same written style as other posts on mattstockton.com
>   - I want it to highlight the following goals:
>     - Build a summarized list of my most favorite books I've read over the past ~1 year
>     - Surface high-level summaries from those books, along with some short but relevant quotes
>     - Discover other books I might be interested in reading, that are lesser known and over 20 years old


Overall, I was pleased with the result, and it didn't take a lot of time to do. Drop me a note and let me know what you think of the reading lists below. If you've got some good reading recommendations, send those my way as well.
