Today, I came across a [tweet by Alex McCaw](https://x.com/maccaw/status/1862159247825399863) asking what topics young adults should learn but aren’t typically taught. This sparked an idea: what could large language models come up with on this topic? Along the way, I decided to test Claude AI’s new functionality for creating custom writing styles.

Here’s how it went:

I started by asking ChatGPT to list five writers known for clear, concise writing on specific topics. Among the responses were James Clear and Morgan Housel — two authors whose styles I really admire. I then asked ChatGPT for **hypothetical examples** of how those writers might approach a topic (I chose 2 topics that were top of mind)

Using these examples, I tested Claude AI’s functionality for creating custom writing styles. This feature allows you to upload writing samples, and Claude will generate a response framework that mirrors those styles in its replies. Claude named the style I created **"Growth Whisperer."**

Next, I asked Claude AI, **“What are 10 important topics that would be a cheat code to know at 21 years old?”** Its first response was solid, but I wanted it to push further. I asked for actionable advice, asked it to rewrite some parts to make the topics more narrative, and ask it to ensure the language stayed simple and direct. I also asked it to expand the list to 15 and refine everything one last time.

In the end, the result was decent — readable, clear, and simple. Many of the items felt like things you already know but forget to apply, and seeing them framed this way was genuinely additive. The entire process took about 10 minutes.

To be transparent, I recorded myself talking about this post and used ChatGPT to build the post using the transcript of that recording. I also revised the post using voice to dictate follow-on prompts, which I think is a real cheat code. One of the best ways I like to use these tools is just to talk to them and then read the text as output. Instead of typing, it actually forces you to iterate faster — you’re not sitting there waiting to type keys. You’re just talking and clicking go, and the results are pretty good.
