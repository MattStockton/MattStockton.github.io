title: "A braindump on how I use AI tools"
---

I recently caught up with some former co-workers and shared a range of AI tips and tricks — from using voice input to reduce friction, to employing meta-prompting for clearer instructions. While I didn’t record the actual conversation, I recalled most of the key points and recorded myself talking through the tips and workflows I use. I also recorded a video of the entire process so you can see firsthand how I leverage these tools. Here's a quick summary of what I did, along with a video of me doing it, and the final output document the process produced.

## The Process

- **Recorded a Brain Dump:**  
  I captured myself explaining all the AI tips and tricks we discussed, covering everything from my favorite tools to strategies like using voice mode and meta-prompting.

- **Transcribed the Recording:**  
  A transcription tool converted my recording into text, preserving the core ideas and insights.

- **Generated a Summary Document:**  
  I used AI to transform the transcript into a structured document. By leveraging voice dictation and meta-prompting, I guided the AI to create a summary with clear headers and bullet points that capture the essence of my discussion.

## Check It Out

I’ve put together a demo video that walks through the full process — from recording to generating the final document. In the video, I share a few tips and workflows I use, offering practical insights for anyone interested in streamlining their own process. You can watch the video here:
