title: "A Brain Dump on How I Use AI Tools"
---

I recently met up with some former co-workers to catch up and share what I’ve been learning about AI. The conversation covered a lot—voice input, meta-prompting, project organization—and I realized afterward that I had probably overwhelmed them with too much information at once. To make it more digestible, I wanted to send them a structured summary of what we talked about. Instead of writing it all out manually, I used AI to generate it. And since I was already doing that, I decided to document the process to show how these tools can help streamline this kind of work.  

Here’s how I did it, plus a breakdown of some of the most useful takeaways.  

## The Process  

1. **Brain Dump:** I recorded myself talking through my AI workflows—covering tools, strategies, and how I actually use them.  
2. **Transcription:** I used a transcription tool to convert the recording into text, keeping all the key insights.  
3. **Structured Summary:** I used AI to refine the transcript into a clear, organized document with headers and bullet points.  

## Key Takeaways from the Video  

- **Voice Input Removes Friction** – Talking to AI instead of typing speeds up idea capture and brainstorming. I use voice mode while running or commuting to get thoughts down quickly. AI then organizes the raw dump into something structured.  
- **Meta Prompting for Better Results** – Instead of guessing how to phrase a prompt, I ask AI to refine it first. This makes responses clearer and more useful.  
- **Organizing AI Workflows with Projects** – Keeping related files, notes, and context in a project-based system makes AI interactions more efficient.  
- **Iterate and Improve Prompts** – The first AI-generated response is rarely perfect. I always refine and tweak prompts, and sometimes I even ask the AI how I could phrase things better.  

## Watch It in Action  

Here’s a video where I walk through the entire workflow, from recording my thoughts to generating a structured document:

Hopefully, this gives you some ideas on how to make AI work for you.
