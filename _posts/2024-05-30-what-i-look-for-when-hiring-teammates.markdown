I previously wrote about the [traits of a good leader in a startup](/2024/04/26/leadership-in-startup-companies.html). I spent some time reflecting on the key traits I value when hiring new teammates. This isn’t a comprehensive list, just some of the key traits that I care about. 

- **Adaptable** - Is not demotivated, overwhelmed, or paralyzed by a change. Is energized by a necessary change or challenge. Knows that experimentation and failure are key components of eventual success.
- **Curious** - Enjoys figuring out how things work, and how systems fit together — within their domain of expertise, and more importantly **outside** their domain of expertise. Has agency to understand how their work impacts the goals of the larger team.
- **Connective Communicator**  - Shares information clearly, with the right people, at the right time. Understands the context teammates have about a topic, and adapts their communication given that context. Continuously considers **“What do others need to know that they do not know yet?”** Takes initiative to write information down in a structured, succinct way, and shares that information openly with teammates.
- **Abundance Mindset** - Believes that individual success doesn’t depend on someone else’s failure. Celebrates the wins of others, and actively helps teammates achieve their goals.
- **Pragmatic** - Has a sound mental model for when a solution is good enough, when a tool is right or wrong for the job, and values **simple solutions** — avoiding shiny objects and distractions. Continuously considers **“What problem are we solving, why are we solving it, and how do we do that in the most practical way possible?”**
- **Team-oriented** - Believes in winning and losing as a team, and uses this mindset to determine where their current leverage point is. Continuously considers **“What is my role right now to help my team succeed given the current context?”**
- **Perseverant** - Believes in progress (however small) in the face of challenge and ambiguity. Believes that returns compound, and any progress (however incremental) is better than lack of action. Continuously considers **“What is the smallest step I can take right now to make progress towards our goals?”**
- **Goal-driven** - Values setting measurable personal and team goals, writing them down, and sharing them with their teammates. Understands that goal-setting helps to reduce ambiguity and increase alignment on a team.
- **Passionate** - Has authentic energy for the problem you are solving. Believes in the mission and vision -- and that genuine believe helps them overcome obstacles, stay focused, and stay positive.

In a future post, I’ll share some interview techniques and questions I use to filter for the above traits. What do you care about when hiring? What’s missing here? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
