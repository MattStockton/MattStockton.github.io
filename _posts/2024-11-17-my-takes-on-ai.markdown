title: "My Takes On AI"
---
I have a lot of different takes on AI, particularly on how the emergence of Generative AI and Large Language Models has drastically expanded both what’s possible with AI and who can harness its potential. I often get asked what I think about where AI is heading and how to approach it, but I haven’t yet taken the time to distill my perspectives — so below are some of those perspectives. This exercise felt worthwhile to me. It forced me to organize my thoughts and condense them down. This isn't comprehensive, but it's where my head was at today. I am sure I missed things. Hopefully you get some value from it. What are your takes? I’d love to hear how others are thinking about this ever-changing space.

### Writing and communication matter more than ever.
Learning how to write clearly has immense leverage. AI tools amplify the results of clear thinking and precise communication. Those who can express themselves effectively unlock better outcomes.

### AI removes friction for personal growth.
You can now learn on your own terms, in a way that aligns with how you think and communicate uniquely. Motivated, curious people can unlock vast amounts of knowledge without waiting for structured programs or external permission.

### There’s still so much to build with what’s already here.
Even if AI progress stopped today, the tools already here are transformational. We haven’t scratched the surface of what can be built on top of them. The opportunity lies in applying these tools creatively and thoughtfully.

### Multimodal AI capabilities are the most creative frontier.
If you’re curious, take a video and upload it to Gemini. You’ll be amazed by the structured outputs it can generate. These capabilities open up entirely new possibilities we’re just beginning to explore.

### AI tools are creating significant and compounding productivity gaps.
Teams that embrace tools like Cursor and Copilot are seeing meaningful productivity gains, especially in certain verticals like coding. These advantages compound over time, creating a snowball effect. Late adopters risk falling far behind.

### Domain expertise + cross-functional collaboration is the winning formula.
The most differentiated skill set today is a domain expert who’s willing to learn and apply these tools. The reverse is equally true: if you know how to use these tools, finding domain experts and bringing them on board creates a moat. Together, you’ll create unmatched leverage.

### The skill set that matters is changing -- it's not just tech that matters now.
The ability to connect dots across disciplines and find patterns will outpace the value of pure technical skills. Humanities, history, philosophy, and anything involving lots of reading and writing will become even more valuable as we navigate this new era.

### Evaluating AI outputs is both old and new -- and more important than ever.
These new models are astonishingly capable but still require rigorous, automated testing. Having robust testing in place allows you to adopt new models faster, ensuring they still work for your use case in a quantitative way. Upskilling newcomers is also critical. Building with LLMs is accessible to a much wider audience, but many lack the testing experience gained from classical software engineering or ML. Addressing this gap is essential.

### AI wrappers solve the hard problem of adoption, and there's no reason to be cynical about them.
By “AI wrappers,” I mean a very light layer of logic / orchestration on top of foundation models. These tools might look simple — easily reproducible within the foundation model’s UI — but they solve the challenge of getting users to adopt and integrate the technology into their workflows. Channel delivery and customer acquisition are hard problems to solve - a lot harder than prompting.

### User experience is everything.
Solving how people interact with AI tools is far more critical than just improving prompts. “Human in the loop” and how that human is integrated into the process defines the success of these tools. This is the real challenge — and the teams that solve it will win.

### Generative AI is just one tool in the toolbox.
Use it where it makes sense. The old tools still work — don’t throw out your entire toolbox. For example, if you need a Linear Regression model, use Linear Regression — not generative AI.

### AI adoption works best from the ground up.
Identify the handful of people in your organization who are excited about AI, let them explore and experiment, and then empower them to teach others. If you don’t have one of these people yet, grow one from within your organization.

### The data flywheel drives compounding improvement.
Designing your product to collect data is critical, and you need an automated way to feed that data back into how you use and improve your models. Don’t ignore this aspect — it makes the compounding effect happen so much faster.

### The future of AI lies in discovering new form factors.
The ways we interact with AI are rapidly changing, and many remain undiscovered. This is one of the most interesting areas to experiment with. For example, I used ChatGPT’s voice mode while on a run to think through and refine the core ideas in this post. I couldn't imagine getting value out of this form factor even a few months ago. What other form factors are yet to be discovered?

### Conclusion
Some of these takes are going to be wrong, and that’s part of the fun. AI is evolving quickly, and everyone is figuring it out as they go. If you don’t have a perspective yet, it might be worth diving in and exploring these tools for yourself. There’s no better way to form a view than by experimenting firsthand. What are your takes? Send me a note, I'd love to hear them.
